When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to share my code with someone else via a centralize repo plus
	I get a backup of it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I could pick up the branch I'm interested in without downloading
	the full repository besides I could be in the middle of coding and an
	automatic update could be disruptive.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branche is a series of logical related commits withing a repository where 
	every commit has a parent commit (except the first one). A clone is a full 
	copy of a repository and a fork is an special kind of clone where you give
	credit to the original author of the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	It makes possible to know if there has been a change in the remote repo 
	marking in time where the divergence ocurred and letting the marge possible
